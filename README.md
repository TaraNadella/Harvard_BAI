# Harvard_BAI
Repo for Harvard's Biological and Artificial Intelligence course (Neuro 140/240). These tutorials are intended as a first introduction to coding for Machine Learning.

# To Dos:

### Make a github account and clone this Repository. For help, you can follow this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository


### Install conda.

Conda is a package management system for python. That is, it allows easily magaing installed libraries (packages),  and sharing them.

Follow the guide here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

### Make a conda environment using the given environment file.

Follow the instructions as given here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

### Install jupyter notebook

If you're using colab instead, you can skip this step.

### Add this new conda environment to your jupyter.

This can be done with the following command:

`python -m ipykernel install --name bai â€”-user`

If you're using google colab, here's a resource that might help: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/75948/how-to-setup-and-run-conda-on-google-colab

### Create an account at wandb.ai, and set it up.

Simply follow steps 1 and 2 here https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart

### Download this dataset for tutorial 2

# You will need to download the dataset from Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data, and unzip the zip files. Easiest way to do this is to have google drive synced on your computer and download/unzip on your computer using the GUI.

So, the train images should be inside the directory: `Harvard_BAI/assignment_2/data/dogs-vs-cats/train/`

### All set!

You are now all set to run tutorial 1 and 2.
